            <h1>About Me and Crochet</h1>
            <p>This is how I got started.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page-text">
            <p>I’ve always loved creating things with my hands, whether it was painting with watercolors, experimenting with oil pastels, or exploring any kind of art that let me bring an idea to life. But it wasn’t until November 2025 that I discovered crochet. A new friend was working on a project and offered to show me the ropes. That day, I was home in chilly Sweden, looking for something to keep me busy, and crochet turned out to be the perfect companion.</p>
            <p>At first, I started small, learning through YouTube tutorials and making simple patches. Soon, I moved on to hair bands, little dolls, coasters, and many other projects. Each stitch became a quiet moment of focus and creativity, a way to relax while making something beautiful from nothing.</p>
            <p>Crochet quickly became more than a hobby; it became a way to express myself, to experiment, and to fill my days with color and warmth. Every finished piece carries a little story, and I’m excited to keep learning, creating, and sharing my handmade creations with the world.</p>
